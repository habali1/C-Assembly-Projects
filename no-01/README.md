# Simple Command-Line Argument Adder

This project consists of two C programs, `addArgs.c` and `proj01.c`, which demonstrate a simple command-line argument addition. The programs take integer arguments from the command line, sum them, and display the result in a formatted output.

## Files

- **addArgs.c**: A C program that sums up integer command-line arguments and prints the sum along with the individual terms in a formatted string.
- **proj01.c**: Identical to `addArgs.c`, included for possible further development or testing.
- **makefile**: A simple Makefile to compile the `addArgs` program and test it.

## Usage

### Compiling the Program

To compile the `addArgs` program, simply run:

```bash
make
