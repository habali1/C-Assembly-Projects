# Control Flow Analysis in C and x86 Assembly

This project explores the control flow structures in C and how they are translated into x86 assembly language. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding conditional statements, loops, and how they are implemented at the assembly level.

## Files

- `x86cf.c`: A C program containing various control flow structures (if-else, while, do-while, and for loops) for analysis.
- `x86cf.obj.txt`: The disassembled output of the compiled `x86cf` program, showing the corresponding assembly instructions.
- `gdb_cmds.txt`: GDB commands file used to automate the debugging process and break at specific points in the code.
- `makefile`: Makefile to compile the C program, generate the assembly code, and disassemble the compiled object file.

## Usage

To compile and analyze the program, use the following commands:

```bash
make x86cf.obj.txt
make gdb
```
## What I Learned

1. **Control Flow in C**: 
   - Reviewed the implementation of various control flow structures in C, including `if-else`, `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops.

2. **Translation to Assembly**: 
   - Observed how high-level control flow constructs are translated into assembly language, specifically how conditions and loops are handled with jumps and conditional instructions.

3. **Using GDB for Debugging**: 
   - Learned to set breakpoints and inspect the flow of a program using GDB, which is crucial for understanding how control structures behave at runtime.

4. **Assembly Instruction Set**: 
   - Gained familiarity with the x86 assembly instruction set, particularly instructions like `cmp`, `jmp`, `je`, `jne`, which are commonly used for implementing control flow.

5. **Manual Code Disassembly**: 
   - Used `objdump` to disassemble the compiled C program, providing insight into the low-level operations corresponding to high-level C constructs.

6. **Understanding Compiler Output**: 
   - Improved the ability to analyze and interpret the assembly output generated by the compiler, focusing on the correspondence between C source code and its assembly equivalent.

7. **Makefile Usage**: 
   - Reinforced the use of Makefiles to automate the compilation, disassembly, and debugging processes, ensuring a streamlined workflow.

8. **Conditional Execution in Assembly**: 
   - Explored how conditions in C are mapped to conditional execution in assembly, with particular emphasis on how different branches are managed by the CPU.
