# Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament

This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) tournament simulator in C. Multiple player strategies are implemented, and the simulator runs matches between them to determine the winner. The project includes a Makefile for compiling and running the program.

## Files

- **rps.c**: The main program file that runs the tournament and handles player registration and match logic.
- **rps.h**: The header file containing type definitions and function prototypes related to the RPS game.
- **pool.c**: Implements a pool structure used to manage players during the tournament.
- **pool.h**: The header file for the pool implementation.
- **registerPlayers.c**: Generated by the `makeRegisterPlayers.py` script, this file registers all the players for the tournament.
- **makeRegisterPlayers.py**: A Python script that generates `registerPlayers.c` based on the available player files.
- **player_*.c**: Various player strategy implementations, where each file implements a specific RPS strategy (e.g., always playing Rock, choosing randomly, etc.).
- **makefile**: A Makefile to compile the program, run tests, and clean up generated files.

## Usage

### Compiling the Program

To compile the program, simply run:

```bash
make
```
## What I Learned

Working on this project taught me several key things:

1. **Modular Programming in C**:
   - I learned how to structure a C program into multiple files, each responsible for specific functionality, and how to manage dependencies between them.

2. **Automating Code Generation**:
   - I gained experience in using Python scripts to automate the generation of C code, which helped in dynamically registering players for the tournament.

3. **Understanding and Implementing Data Structures**:
   - I implemented and used a pool data structure to manage players during the tournament, which reinforced my understanding of linked lists and memory management in C.

4. **Makefile Usage**:
   - I improved my skills in writing and using Makefiles to automate the compilation, testing, and cleanup processes, especially in a multi-file C project.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - I practiced testing different player strategies in the RPS game and used debugging tools like GDB to troubleshoot and refine the program.
