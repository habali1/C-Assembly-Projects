# Project Repository

Welcome to my C&x86 Assembly Projects Repository! This repository contains a diverse set of programming projects that showcase different aspects of software development, including C++ programming, buffer overflow testing, linked list operations, and more.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of various projects designed to illustrate key concepts and techniques in software development. The projects cover a range of topics, including:

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of linked lists and Red-Black Trees.
- **Security**: Examples of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and how to test for them.
- **Algorithms**: Implementations of algorithms such as max heaps.
- **Game Development**: Simple games like Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Each project includes relevant source code files, build instructions, and sometimes scripts for testing or debugging.

## Information for no' s

From 01 to 11 I learned how to solve simple tasks.
From 12 to 16 I implemented what I learned on a bit harder tasks
From 17 to 19 are hardest tasks that I accomplished or still continue on generating.
